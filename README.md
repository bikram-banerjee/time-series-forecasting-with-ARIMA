# ‚è±Ô∏è Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

This project demonstrates time series forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The objective is to analyze and forecast future values based on historical time series data.

## üéØ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Explore and visualize a time series dataset.
- Understand its stationarity and seasonality.
- Apply data transformations (if necessary) to make it suitable for forecasting.
- Build an ARIMA model and tune its parameters.
- Forecast future values and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## üìä Dataset Description

> üìÅ The dataset used in this project is yfinance dataset which is a univariate time series (e.g., monthly sales, temperature, etc.). The file contains a time column (e.g., Date/Month/Year) and a target variable to forecast (e.g., sales/temperature/etc.).

## üß† Algorithms and Techniques Used

This notebook uses the following techniques:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Time parsing, indexing, and cleaning
   - Handling missing values
   - Visualizing trends, seasonality, and noise

2. **Stationarity Testing**
   - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test

3. **Transformations**
   - Log transformation to stabilize variance
   - Differencing to achieve stationarity

4. **Model Selection**
   - Auto ARIMA or manual tuning using ACF/PACF plots
   - Parameters: (p, d, q) ‚Üí ARIMA(p, d, q)

5. **Model Training**
   - Using `statsmodels.tsa.arima_model` or `pmdarima`

6. **Forecasting**
   - Forecasting future values
   - Plotting forecast vs actual
   - Evaluation using RMSE/MAE/MAPE (update if used)
